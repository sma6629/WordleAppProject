Description : This is an android app that plays the word puzzle game known as Wordle. In this game, the user tries to guess a randomly generated five-letter word from a list of valid words in the english language. The user gets five attempts to guess the correct word. With each subsequent user input, the app checks whether each letter is part of the correct word. If the user inputs a letter that's in the correct spot, it is highlighted in green. If the letter is part of the correct word, but not in the correct spot, it is highlighted in yellow. Finally, if the letter is not part of the correct word, it will be highlighted in red. If the user input is invalid i.e. the input is not a valid word in the english language, or it is not a five letter word, the user receives a message saying the input is invalid.
